<br>Call of Duty Call of Duty is an award-winning first-person shooter series. The series started on the PC, and then expanded to include gaming and portable systems. It was also inspired by several games and released in conjunction with it. The events of the first five games of the series take place during World War II, with the exception of Call of Duty 4: Modern Warfare, and the events of the last five games of the series take place in modern, developed and very advanced eras, with the exception of Call of Duty: Ghosts
Activision and Aspire Media funded and published parts of the series, while Infinity Word developed the first game and some other games in the series, and some other teams participated in the development, most notably Sledgehammer Games Studio and Treyarch Studio, which developed some of the main parts. In the series, other studios developed some secondary parts, such as Gray Matter Interactive Studio, Spark Unlimited, Bay Studios, Amaze Entertainment and Rebellion Developments.
